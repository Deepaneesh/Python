## Factors & It's Occurances

To find the **factors** of a number and their **occurrences**, you essentially break the number into its prime factors and determine how many times each prime factor occurs in its decomposition.

### Steps:

1.  **Find the Prime Factors**: Break down the number into its prime components.

2.  **Count Occurrences**: For each prime factor, count how many times it divides the number.
