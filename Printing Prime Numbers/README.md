## Printing Prime numbers

This script efficiently prints all prime numbers up to a given number $n$. A prime number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The script uses a helper function, `is_prime()`, to check if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root. The main function, `print_primes(n)`, generates a list of all prime numbers from 2 to $n$ and prints them in a clean, readable format. This approach ensures simplicity and clarity, making it easy to modify for different ranges or use cases. For example, calling the function with $n = 50$ will output all prime numbers between 2 and 50.
