## Checking panrindrome

A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, the words "madam", "radar", and the number 121 are palindromes. Palindromes are often used in puzzles and word games due to their symmetry and unique properties. In programming, palindromes are commonly identified by checking if the original string or number is equal to its reverse.
