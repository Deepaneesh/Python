## Fibonacci Sequences 

The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence begins as \( 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \dots \), where each term is calculated as \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \). It is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who introduced the sequence to the Western world in his book *Liber Abaci*. The Fibonacci sequence has widespread applications in mathematics, computer science, and nature, appearing in phenomena such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, and the spiral patterns of shells. It also serves as a foundation for solving problems in dynamic programming and recursion in computer science. In Python, the Fibonacci sequence can be generated using a loop, recursion, or dynamic programming techniques.
